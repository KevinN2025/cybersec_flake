This is merely a flake config made for cybersec and penetration testing purposes.
For my fellow Nix users feel free to copy this flake.nix file for your personal workflow

run the following command to install all the packages:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KevinN2025/cybersec_flake.git
nix develop
```
Note: This is over 8mgb of storage, so it'll take a couple minute to download every package.
